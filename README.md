# 📚 javascript: My Comprehensive JavaScript Learning Hub

This repository is my personal, evolving resource for mastering JavaScript, from the fundamental concepts of ES5 to the latest features in ES2024+. It contains code examples, small projects, and detailed notes illustrating key concepts and best practices.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a robust and well-structured collection of executable code that demonstrates a clear understanding of the JavaScript language.

**Key Learning Focus Areas:**

* **Fundamentals:** Data types, operators, control flow, functions, and scoping.
* **Modern JS (ES6+):** Arrow functions, `let`/`const`, Promises, `async/await`, spread/rest operators, Destructuring.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Prototypes, Classes, Inheritance, and the `this` keyword.
* **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Callbacks, Promise chains, and handling asynchronous operations gracefully.
* **Browser/DOM Manipulation:** Selecting elements, event handling, and manipulating the structure of a web page.
* **Node.js Basics:** Module system (`require`/`import`), file I/O, and server-side JavaScript concepts.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The content is organized into logical folders to make navigation and concept review easy.

| Folder | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01_basics` | Variables, types, operators, and basic conditional statements. | 🟢 Ready |
| `02_functions_scope` | Function declarations, expressions, closures, and the event loop. | 🟢 Ready |
| `03_oop_classes` | Object literal, constructors, prototype inheritance, and ES6 Classes. | 🚧 In Progress |
| `04_async_js` | Promises, `fetch` API examples, `async/await`, and error handling. | 💡 Planning |
| `05_dom_projects` | Small front-end projects focusing on manipulating the Document Object Model. | 💡 Planning |
| `06_advanced_concepts` | Generators, Iterators, Proxies, and Reflect API. | 💡 Planning |

## 🏃 Getting Started

Since this is a collection of JavaScript files, you can run most of the examples directly in your terminal using **Node.js** or by linking the files to an HTML page.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** installed on your system to run the files outside of a browser environment.

### Running the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/basantmahato/javascript.git](https://github.com/basantmahato/javascript.git)
    cd javascript
    ```

2.  **Run a specific file (using Node.js):**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file you want to test, and run:
    ```bash
    node 01_basics/variables.js 
    # Replace 'variables.js' with the file you want to execute
    ```

3.  **Run a DOM Example (Requires a Browser):**
    For files inside the `05_dom_projects` folder (or similar), you will need to open the corresponding `.html` file in your web browser.
